# JapaneseNames

Japanese name parser based on ENAMDIC

## Overview

JapaneseNames provides an interface to the [ENAMDIC file](http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/enamdict_doc.html).

Currently the main method is `split` which, given a kanji and kana representation of a name splits
into to family/given names.

```ruby
  parser = JapaneseNames::Parser.new
  parser.split('堺雅美', 'さかいマサミ')  #=> [['堺', '雅美'], ['さかい', 'マサミ']]
```


## ENAMDICT

This library comes packaged with a compacted version of the [ENAMDIC file](http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/enamdict_doc.html)
at `bin/enamdict.min`.

This file can be regenerated by `rake enamdict:refresh`, which downloads, extracts, and compiles the ENAMDICT file.


## TODO

* **Additional Methods:** Add additional methods to access the ENAMDICT file.

* **Performance:** Currently name lookup takes approx 0.5 sec. Benchmarking and/or a native C
implementation of the dictionary would be nice.

* **Gender Lookup:** Use m/f dictionary flag to infer name gender.
